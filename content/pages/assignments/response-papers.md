Assignment
----------

12 of the class sessions feature a prompt for a short response paper (listed in the table below). Students will pick any six to write. These papers should engage explicitly with one or more of the readings. The intention of the papers is to help students digest the readings in preparation for class discussion, and it is perfectly acceptable if they raise more questions than answers. If students wish to write additional response papers, the six highest grades will be recorded.

Social Learning
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Each of the assigned readings from this week connects the development of mental abilities with transformative social interaction. What does an emphasis on social relationships reveal about learning that might otherwise be obscured in educational settings?

Apprenticeship as a Research Topic
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}

Apprenticeship as a Research Method
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Describe some of the empirical advantages to studying a system of knowledge from the standpoint of an apprentice. Are there any challenges or disadvantages particular to this methodology—acknowledged or not by the authors of this week's assigned readings?

Initiation Ritual and Rites of Passage
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Describe what you learned during last week's tea ceremony lesson, and the significance of how that knowledge was imparted. Would you characterize the lesson itself as an initiation ritual? A form of apprenticeship? You may wish to refer back to the DeCoker article and / or to the film "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" (from Session 3) as points of comparison.

Schooling
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Drawing on one assigned reading from last week and one assigned reading from this week, compare rites of passage and schooling as modes education (knowledge transmission) and socialization (the transformation of the self in society)? Do rites of passage and rituals of initiation accomplish things that schools can't—and vice versa?

Social Reproduction
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
If schools in modern democracies (e.g., France, U.K, and U.S.) are designed to promote social mobility, how, according to this week's assigned readings, do they systematically perpetuate social inequalities? Is this an inevitable part of institutionalized learning, or is there something that can be done about this?

Language Socialization
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
As an autoethnographer, reflect on last week's lesson in improvisational comedy. How did the structure of the lesson reflect the instructors' pedagogical goals? Can you describe the lesson as a form of language socialization? Could you analyze it in terms of "habitus"?

{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
What is the relationship between apprenticeship within a community of practice and language socialization within a speech community?
